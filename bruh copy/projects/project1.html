            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Blend is a company that offers assistance to its users through every step of the home-buying process. They reached out to our class, User-Centered Research and Evaluation, to ask for help in finding a solution to the problem of home-buyers not committing to purchasing a home</p>
            <p>Our group conducted research and discovered that while early home-buyers were not financially prepared, most early home-buyers found it more difficult to feel emotionally prepared to commit to home-buying. First-time home-buyers need that emotional assurance in order to be ready to not only be financially prepared but also ready to commit to buying a home. With this, the problem can be reframed by asking: <b>How can we encourage first-time homebuyers to commit to purchasing a home by improving their emotional preparedness?</b></p>
        </div>
        <div class="project-research">
            <h2>Gathering Insights</h2>
            <p>For our research, we used both generative and evaluative research methods with over fifteen unique participants. Through our research, we gained an understanding of the biggest obstacles first-time homebuyers face and focused on crafting a solution that would better prepare potential buyers to overcome these obstacles.</p>
            <p>First, I created a <b>stakeholder</b> and <b>customer journey</b> to better understand the home-buying process as well as identify any pain points and opportunities along the home-buying journey.</p>
            <img src="../images/project-homies/journey-map.png" alt="journey map showing the stages of home buying">
            <p>As a team, we all performed background research on who first-time homebuyers are as well are their general demographics to help us better understand whom we are designing for.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We employed think-aloud protocols to help us understand how first-time home buyers might use a website or service with features we identify as important to the users. Specifically, we used the UK mortgage platform Habito, to help identify the areas our first-time home buyers felt the least confident in as well as areas that contributed to first-time home buyers not being committal to buying a home. </p>
            <img src="../images/project-homies/interview.png" alt="journey map showing the stages of home buying">
            <p>We performed <b>contextual inquiries</b> with the aim of betting understanding how people engage themselves in finding the right home and how prepared there are as well as any factors that might influence these aspects. After the contextual inquires our team came together to <b>affinity diagram</b>. The affinity diagram revealed insights and patterns through the groupings that were made. We found that there was a clear connection between level of commitment and methodology for finding homes. Additionally, the more emotionally prepared the buyer felt, the more home-buying knowledge they had. </p>
            <img src="../images/project-homies/affinity-diagram.png" alt="journey map showing the stages of home buying">
            <p>Once we identified the user needs we thought were most vital to our project, we developed storyboards. The storyboards encouraged the team to think broadly about potential solutions to the specific needs we found. Each storyboard contained a safe idea, a risky idea and a very risky idea.</p>
            <img src="../images/project-homies/storyboard.png" alt="journey map showing the stages of home buying">
            <p>Using the storyboards, we speed dated them with participants to validate these needs exist and to see which ideas had the strongest positive reactions. Most interviewees validated the need for emotional assurance throughout the home-buying process. They spoke about the emotional burden one would expect in the home-buying process and that they would strictly prefer receiving emotional assurance from people they are familiar with over strangers or CUIs.  </p>
