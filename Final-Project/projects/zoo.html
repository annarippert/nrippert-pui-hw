                <h5 class="project-detail-sub-headers">OVERVIEW</h5>
                <p>The Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium has received a grant from an anonymous donor to increase visitors and engagement at the Zoo in response to 2+ years of pandemic. We were tasked with analyzing the data, modeling it and mapping it to the various stakeholders.</p>
                <p>To solve this problem our team designed 18 engaging screen displays that increase visitor engagement and accessibility while cutting down on wait times. After iterating and conducting critiques, we pitched to our entire class of 40+ students and to a panel of pretend CEOS, marketing managers, financial advisors and other business representatives through an intriguing zoo scavenger hunt experience that was implemented into our designs.</p><br>

        <div class="project-problem alternate">
            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>Following two difficult years of COVID, the Pittsburgh Zoo was struggling to bring back visitors and keep them engaged. Due to the many COVID restrictions, they were not sure how to revitalize the city's animal-loving culture.</p>
        </div>

        <!--The research and insights I found throughout the process-->
        <div class="project-research">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <img src="../images/project-zoo/board.png" alt="evidence of whiteboarding various mental models to better understand the data">
            <p>I was given a the notes from a set of interviews the Pittsburgh Zoo had conducted with from various stakeholders to analyze and an excel sheet with data about the Zoo. No other research was allowed which made it challenging and limited in the information we received. I was therefore forced to make assumptions and concretely stated them when creating mental models and user flows. </p>
            <img src="../images/project-zoo/iterations.png" alt="process of how we went grom grayscale to color">
            <p>After rapidly brainstorming many ideas, we realized there were many avenues we could take this project and decided to utilize a parallel prototyping approach.</p>
            <p>Over the 3 weeks dedicated to the project, we were able to use class time to duct four critiques and get valuable feedback. We iterated in stages, starting from screens designed in grayscale, moving to adding color to the screens, after validating the designs we added animations and interactivity.</p>
            <img src="../images/project-zoo/board.png" alt="entire Figma file illustrating all the prototypes we created">
            <p>Being able to parallel prototype allowed us to explore many different possible paths and select a path that achieved out objectives the best based on feedback from the critiques.</p>

        <!--What the solution looked like with videos as samples-->
        <div class="project-solution alternate" id="project-solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Once we finalized our screens, we created an immersive pitch that demonstrated the value our screens would bring to the Pittsburgh Zoo. To help make the pitch more engaging, my team employed roles where we had a “Zoo Employee” and a “designer” to help walk our client through the screens and better understand how the screens would work in a simulated context and environment.</p>
