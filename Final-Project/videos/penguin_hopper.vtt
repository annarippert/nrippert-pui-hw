Hello this is my game called Penguin Hopper. 

00:00:04.10 --> 00:00:11.10
The viewers are presented with four different options: play the game, view the rules, build your own map or view the high scoreboard. 

00:00:11.20 --> 00:00:17.00
To start of the rule section, basically describes the objectives behind the game as well as a little story. 

00:00:17.10 --> 00:00:21.00
Over here describes the controls you need to know for playing 

00:00:21.10 --> 00:00:26.00
and you also need to sign that you state that you accept the mission.

00:00:26.10 --> 00:00:34.00
So if I sign just my initials here and press enter the game starts.
